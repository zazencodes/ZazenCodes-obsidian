# The Ultimate Guide to Prompting   Latent Space Sept 20 2024

Open source or smaller models benefit from chain of thought- simply add "think step by step"

some of the best prompting techniques are being tuned back into the models themselves, as we’ve seen with o1 and Chain-of-Thought (see our OpenAI episode). Similarly, OpenAI recently announced 100% guaranteed JSON schema adherence, and Anthropic, Cohere, and Gemini all have JSON Mode (not sure if 100% guaranteed yet)

Jailbreaks get fine-tuned into the model to fix them

Role playing prompts (eg you’re an expert software developer) probably don’t do anything in terms of accuracy

Ensemble methods help mitigate hallucinations

Smaller models like gpt-4o-mini can be run many times for cheaper than larger equivalents like 4o. Can be useful convined with ensemble ideas

I spent 20 hours prompt engineering for a task and DSPy beat me in 10 minutes.
